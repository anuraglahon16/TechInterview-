Geek love's to drink cold coffee after coding for long hour's.
One fine day Geek went to his favourite coffee shop in the town 
and asked for a cup of cold coffee. The shopkeeper told him that 
he is their lucky customer and had an offer for the Geek. The offer 
was that for an amount of N they will fill Geek's cup with N units of 
cold coffee, the offer doesn't over yet. After consuming initial N units 
of coffee the shopkeeper will again refill his cup with half the amount
of coffee that Geek consumed in previous refill, and will keep on refilling
his cup till the amount to refill becomes nil i.e. 0 (Assume Geek can consume 
infinite amount of coffee and shop also has infinite amount coffee). Now Geek 
is curious to know that how many units of coffee will Geek get for Mth refill. 
Being Geek's friend help him out with his problem.
